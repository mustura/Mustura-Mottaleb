# [WebLOAD](https://reviews.financesonline.com/p/webload/)
WebLOAD is load testing tool,performance testing tools web applications(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebLOAD) Load testing tool WebLOAD combines performance, scalability, and integrity as a single process for the verification of web and mobile applications.
**Testing Approach:** WebLOAD Performance testing
**Testing Level:** Web Application testing
**Target application domain:** Web Application system
## Main Features
* **Cloud Performance Testing**: Cloud testing is the process of analysing web application performance in a cloud computing domain. Cloud testing is very important for the organization, they faced problem to related with cost and time so that they can support the various cloud to perform the all type testing. 
* **Analytics**: WebLOAD provides the most powerful monitoring tools. WebLOAD fixed the integration with application performance management tools. When developer uses the WebLOAD for performance web application, they can easily use the WebLOAD transaction to the server.  
* **Mobile Load Testing**: WebLOAD introduces many ways to load testing by using mobile devices. WebLOAD works with perfectomobile, for helping to calculate the real experience thus  developing to the machine on a real mobile system. 
* **Server-side performance**: WebLoad integrates output data from server -side operating system, web server, application server, networks, database server and other data to help decide of the problem. Server-side data is seen as part of the WebLOAD performance analytics report in real time.
## Pros
* it’s a robust testing platform and flexible.
* Gives developers access to running scripts.
* It’s an efficient load testing tools.
* Developers can dynamically run the script, and even use different virtual machine.
* WebLOAD include an integrated development environment with a wide range of tools. 
* WebLOAD is also designed to generate loads from cloud-based source from windows or linux computer.
* It is fast.
## Cons
* Finds only crashes (typical of most fuzzers)
* File input only
* Linux/OSX only
* Need to build target from sourse
* Gets stuck on magic values
* No native parallelisation
## Main characteristics
* Create and edit loads tests.
* Execute and schedule tests run.
* Share result and tests.
## Required information / models
WebLOAD provides a single unified command and control interface that we can create execute, schedule and analyse tests from the web browser. WebLoad test for web and mobile application. Its designed as an open framework platform with any tools and technology. 
IDE allows to load test for creating the native javaScript scripting language through recording and scripting. On the other hand WebLOAD console generate test description and executes test on the real time and querying sever output data.
In order to The Web dashboard is an integrated database sever that enables test results.
## Target platform and dependencies
The tool is written in javaScipt.
The tool is from RadView power the most demanding performance professionals in the world with enterprise scale load testing. WebLOAD converts the action into a test file and recording with network technology like HTTP / HTTPS(SSL,TLS), SOAP, HTML5, WebDAV. WebLOAD produce javaScript which is the flexible for the developer.
XML and JSON can be represented in a javaScript. XML and JSON values, can be perform which is very easy to edit. 

**Dependencies:** 
* Windows, Linux, WebRM.
## Updates
Last two years before in a very stable version.  

**Latest update:** 2018-12-04
**First release date:** December 2014
## Licensing /Cost
**Commercial / Free Edition available.**
## Usage examples
There are multiple examples of tools that used the afl, as they are presented in the official afl site. Some instances are:
* [Mobile Device]( https://www.radview.com/performance-testing-with-real-mobile-devices/): about a performance testing
* [Webiste]( https://www.radview.com/performance-testing-tools-lp/): about general load and analyse performance.

## Part 2 
## Case study: WebLOAD Testing Tools.

* **Q2.1. What is the purpose of the sw/lib, i.e. what does it aim to do for users/developers?** 
WebLOAD is easy to use for testing performance and verifies the scalabilities and integrity of the web and mobile application. WebLOAD provides the most powerful monitoring tools so that developer uses the WebLOAD for performance web application, they can easily use the WebLOAD transaction to the server and Developers can dynamically run the script, and even use different virtual machine. 

* **Q2.2. What are the key technologies used to develop the lib?** 
  
  - Test session written in JavaScript.
  - network technology like HTTP / HTTPS(SSL,TLS), SOAP, HTML5, WebDAV

* **Q2.3. What kind of automated testing tools are used to test the sw/lib (including but possible more than YTT) and what are their key features?** 
There are many multiple automated testing tools for different purposes as you can see [here]( https://www.outsource2india.com/software/articles/top-10-automation-testing-tools.asp). They use various automated testing tools for performance testing, API testing, Web testing, Mobile testing and functional testing. Junit is important for the test-driven development and it is useful for the testing frameworks. Kataloan studio support integration. The result of kataloan studio build in report that is very easy to explore in PDF, HTML, Excel or CSV. Appium tools allows the tester to use real devices, emulators and simulators.  

* **Q2.4. Which features of the automated testing tools are currently used by the test suite?**
For testing there are many popular tools as I mentioned before, most of the other reference are Selenium which is the popular tools for testing web application. Selenium introduces a replay method to write accurate tests without knowing scripting language. 

* **Q2.5. Which features of the automated testing tools are NOT used by the test suite?** 
There are some features that they use but sometimes codeless tools works worth.
